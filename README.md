I'm an **SSV Ambassador** and passionate **Ξthereum enthusiast** ⟠ diving deep into the intersection of decentralized technologies and data-driven insights within the Web3 ecosystem.

My core focus involves exploring, analyzing, and building understanding around:

* 📊 **On-chain Data Science:** Uncovering patterns, trends, and behaviors hidden within blockchain data using SQL, Python, and specialized platforms.
* 📈 **DeFi Analysis:** Deconstructing decentralized finance protocols, evaluating yield strategies, assessing risks, and understanding economic mechanisms.
* 📉 **Quantitative Analysis:** Researching, modeling, and (eventually) backtesting data-centric strategies for crypto markets.
* 🏦 **Real-World Assets (RWA):** Investigating the protocols, challenges, and opportunities surrounding the tokenization of traditional assets on-chain.

I'm committed to **building and learning in public**, sharing my analyses, code, dashboards, and insights as I navigate these rapidly evolving fields.
